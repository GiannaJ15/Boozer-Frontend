  // This function is supposed to reccomend drinks based on the weather. I was going to search through the drinks for the drinks containing dark liquor, light liquor, whatever, then put them in an array and on each div render a .random drink HOWEVER, the cocktailContainer currently only holds the skimpy version of the cocktail information. The cocktail card holds the hearty information on each cocktail-- ive tried to get the info from the cocktail card up to the cocktail container, except that means we'd have to render a cocktail card before we have acccess to that information.. ive also tried to fetch information on an individual cocktail directly from cocktail container by iterating through the state of cocktails, and making a fetch request to each cocktails show page then adding each cocktail to a state called "full cocktail objs" using the spread operator, so that the previos cocktail added would still be there. But, it came out messy.. so we're just going to do it by name
